This work is done as a part of the workshop conducted by Applied AI Course on Amazon Apparel Recommendation Engine. The data has been taken from Amazon.com in a policy compliant manner. 

# Objective

The recommendation engine, uses information about 1,80,000 products and each product will have multiple features named.
We will try multiple techniques using text/title and image to recommend similar products/items.
Each product/item has 19 features in the raw dataset. Out of these 19 features, we will be using only 7 features namely:

1. asin ( Amazon standard identification number)
2. brand ( brand to which the product belongs to )
3. color ( Color information of apparel, it can contain many colors as a value ex: red and black stripes )
4. product_type_name (type of the apperal, ex:Tshirt )
5. medium_image_url ( url of the image )
6. title (title of the product)
7. formatted_price (price of the product)
